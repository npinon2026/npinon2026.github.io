      <h5 class="w3-center">By: ShushMyst</h5>
      <p class="w3-justify">There are two categories in this world. There are those who live in reality while there are others living in a fantasy.</p>
      <p class="w3-justify">What's the difference? One lives in a life of cruel truths while the other relies on beautiful lies. Reality is more on 
      facing the world, it's all about the survival of the fittest. Meanwhile, fantasy is finding a way to change it, to make it more beautiful in a 
      sense. Complete opposites, if I might say. </p>
      <p class="w3-justify"> Yet they both need each other. </p>
      <p class="w3-justify"> To cross the world between fantasy and reality is a dream indeed, to have the ability to live in reality yet experience something from fantasy is 
      something that you would only expect from a book. </p>
      <p class="w3-justify"> But it's possible. </p>
      <p class="w3-justify"> At least for Ilyse and Anton. </p>
      <p class="w3-justify"> Ilyse. What to say about her? Perhaps an ever so warming breeze that comes at the coldest of moments in life. She's no angel though. Honestly, 
      no one is, but every time she opens her mouth to say the most bizarre of things, one can't help but find themselves bursting in laughter. </p>
      <p class="w3-justify"> Anton. He's normal. A guy who does the every day things of reality. He's pretty cool, though he can be quite bland at times, but really, can you 
      blame him? The world is fighting over whether or not climate change is real. Flying cars were supposed to be a thing by now but in the end, we are still arguing about such 
      nonsense. At least that's what he thinks. </p>
      <p class="w3-justify"> Ilyse provides Anton an escape route from reality, while Anton helps Ilyse survive such reality. They complement each other, don't you think? </p>
      <p class="w3-justify"> Then again, there are small moments in life that can become a changing point to fate itself. </p>
      <p class="w3-justify"> Such as when you find yourself with unnatural abilities. </p>
      <p class="w3-justify"> Right, quite the turning point indeed </p>
      <p class="w3-justify"> Unnatural abilities in real life are the same as having fantasy cross the borders of reality. They never get along, but this one time, just this once, 
      at such a young age these two children were able to defy the natural law of physics. </p>
      <p class="w3-justify"> But what are these unnatural abilities that they've received you may ask? </p>
      <p class="w3-justify"> Well, think of it as this. </p>
      <p class="w3-justify"> Anton is the embodiment of reality. Reality is survival. It's either to be destroyed or to destroy. People aren't kind in this world, your friends are 
      just your enemies that haven't betrayed you yet. Trust and bonds are so fragile that one mistake can cause it to shatter in an instant. One needs to shield themselves for the 
      better or be engulfed in this world of destruction. </p>
      <p class="w3-justify"> Destruction...that's the key word. </p>
      <p class="w3-justify"> Ilyse is the embodiment of fantasy. Fantasy is change. We are able to create different perspectives, scenarios and people who changed our hearts no matter 
      if they are lies or not. Be it movies, tv shows, books or even games. It helped us change our view of the world, it helped us find once more the beauty that is trapped in it. Heck, 
      it even saved thousands of lives! It made us cry and laugh. It made us understand and be understood. We were able to live in a world that's filled with only a gentle breeze of 
      nostalgia in the air. All of those that came to life as our mind's creations. </p>
      <p class="w3-justify"> Creation...that's it. </p>
      <p class="w3-justify"> You see where I'm going here? </p>
      <p class="w3-justify"> Anton is able to destroy and manipulate atoms, the foundation of the universe. </p>
      <p class="w3-justify"> Ilyse is able to create anything she comes up with under her imagination in the condition of it not affecting the basic principles of reality, such as 
      the concept of life itself. </p>
      <p class="w3-justify"> Polar opposites I told you. </p>
      <p class="w3-justify"> You may be wondering, what exactly am I trying to say? </p>
      <p class="w3-justify"> These two are but one of those with abilities like any other, it has become a rare but also common occurrence by then. They are no different from the others, 
      but they have been blessed even more. </p>
      <p class="w3-justify"> When the Gods gave them their abilities, who knows what they were thinking? Such power could destroy the whole world at once. It was a power similar to 
      that of a God, and yet even I wasn't afraid. </p>
      <p class="w3-justify"> When I first met them I already knew about their unique distinctness from the rest. Ilyse would always stick by Anton while the other would come to be 
      protective of her. Perhaps they were somehow connected by an invisible thread. A thread that goes beyond what some might consider fate. </p>
      <p class="w3-justify"> Or perhaps that's just the way reality is, coincidences. For the better or even for the worse. </p>

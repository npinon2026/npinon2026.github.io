      <h5 class="w3-center">By: ShushMyst</h5>
      <p> A boy who is famous for his beautiful captures online lost interest in photography since he couldn't make 
      a photo that would spark joy in him.<br>His mother persuaded him to bring his camera when they went on a trip to a crowded place, 
      amusement park or whatever it is. The boy tries to find inspiration but to no luck so he just randomly took a picture of a crowd when 
      he was on a bridge.<br>A person stands out as the light focused onto her, catching the boy's attention. The boy silently followed her 
      and took random pictures at whatever she was doing until he reached her and the girl finally notices him.<br>The boy thought the girl would 
      ignore him but instead, she noticed the camera pointing at her and so she smiled brightly.<br>The boy took the photo.<br>Then a big firework 
      appeared and soon their parents called for them and so the girl went off first, the boy stood there for a while until his mother reached 
      him and so they left.<br>The boy would soon post the photos online, each with their own titles, which would garner the attention of many. 
      <br>The boy smiled at the photos, meanwhile, the girl saw the post online and so she too smiled.</p>

      <p class="w3-justify">Writing was one of the few things I was passionate about as a little girl, and it still is to this day.<br>As a child with a vivid imagination, I had a hard time coping with the fact that reality
      could never reach my expectations since no matter how hard I tried my dreams were no better than a fictional fairy tale. </p>
      <p class="w3-justify">It is through writing that I was able to bring to life those fairytales I created. I found joy in it and learned far more in the general aspects of life. (Surprisingly enough)<br>All in all, 
      writing has had a huge impact on who I am as a person, and I am glad that little me didn't lose the opportunity to pick up a pen.</p>

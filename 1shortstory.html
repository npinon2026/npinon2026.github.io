      <h5 class="w3-center">By: ShushMyst</h5>
      <p>Miya truly did love Magnus and Magnus did so too. However, when Miya left, Magnus knew that this was the last time they would see each other and started moving on.<br>His other friend 
      Lemi began accompanying him the same way he once did with Miya. They slowly found themselves growing closer and soon, their hearts now belonged to each other.<br>Magnus loved Miya, perhaps if things were 
      different they would've been together.<br>However, the world isn't so kind. The two that once bonded has now cut the thread that connects their fate.<br>Forever in his heart will she remain as his first love, 
      but now, all that his heart is is Lemi.</p>
      <p>Miya loved Magnus and she will forever love him. Even after marrying the noble she was arranged with, all that he was to her was a mere stepping stone towards the greater good. He did not 
      care for her as a loved one and neither did she.<br>When Miya heard that Magnus was getting married to his close friend, she couldn't bear to attend their wedding.<br>Even when hearing the news she couldn't hold 
      back her broken tears.<br>Perhaps all that she could do was sent a gift to commemorate such a special day, and perhaps it would also serve as a proper parting gift. The hope that she clinged on to was long gone, 
      all that she could do now was look forward for the better of the kingdom.<br>All would've been well. Would've.<br>Shortly after the marriage of Lemi and Magnus, Magnus developed an illness that soon killed him.
      <br>Shattering not only Lemi, his wife, but also Miya, who couldn't bear to leave her room after stumbling upon the news. <br>Miya couldn't accept this, she became the queen for the sake of Magnus, the only person 
      who gave her a reason to pick the path she chose. She soon fell into darkness as her world lost its only light. At that time, she thought of something. The orb. The orb that held the kingdom together has the power 
      to bring someone back from the dead, with the price of draining all of its magic. Using it for personal reasons was forbidden as draining its magic would result in the fall of the kingdom itself. As the queen, she 
      couldn't do such a thing, but then again who cares. The world has never treated her the same way Magnus did, even after becoming queen she was still treated with spite among the many, only being treated right when 
      she carries the burden of all. Magnus' death may have been what fused her, but it was the actions of the people towards her that resulted in the bomb she carries. And so she did it.</p>
      <p>She silently went to the sacred 
      tree keeping the orb and drained its power to bring back the one she loves. It worked, the people in the village considered it a miracle, and Lemi was the most overjoyed. Miya went to the village and saw him truly for 
      the final time with the woman he now loves as she returned to the kingdom bearing a broken smile. This smile wasn't just for the fact that Magnus has been brought back from the dead but also from the mix emotions to the 
      consequences of her actions. Then again, she has done her duty as the queen, she was merely returning the favor as Miya.</p>

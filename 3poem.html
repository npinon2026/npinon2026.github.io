      <h5 class="w3-center">By: ShushMyst</h5>
      <p class="w3-center">"For the land of Teyvat is perfect and true"<br>My dear child, they have lied to you.<br>For beneath the stars that light up the sky<br>Are the hidden truths among the lie</p>
      <p class="w3-center">My dear child, have you heard of the fable?<br>About the seven knights that ruled the table<br>But don't be fooled by their innocent smiles<br>For as I said, it is all a lie</p>
      <p class="w3-center">The pyro knight, whose passion burned bright<br>A fleeting sun that shines its own light<br>But have you heard of her painstaken cry?<br>That pierces upon the bloody night sky?</p>
      <p class="w3-center">The electro knight, a being unpredictable<br>Among the rest, she stands so special<br>But a failure she is, for she has yet to see<br>That even she cannot last an eternity</p>
      <p class="w3-center">The hydro knight, so pure and just<br>Morals of righteousness, a being you trust<br>But beneath her beauty, a dark loom stares<br>Even she cannot judge those unfair</p>
      <p class="w3-center">The dendro knight, who knows no bounds<br>The secrets of the world, once lost now found<br>But what is the price of the secret she keeps?<br>Why is it, the ground continues to bleed?</p>
      <p class="w3-center">The geo knight, whose decisions are set<br>A contract is forged, an agreement is met<br>And yet how are you sure you aren't defied?<br>By the man who's tied with the divine</p>
      <p class="w3-center">The cryo knight, whose love is so gentle<br>A being adored by the nation she handles<br>Oh how cruel the world is, as it is all for naught<br>A love so pure, has been left to rot</p>
      <p class="w3-center">The anemo knight, one who is free<br>A friend of time, a bard who flees<br>And yet past and future he may know<br>He has yet to reap what he has sow</p>
      <p class="w3-center">My dear child, it is all a lie<br>Such as the stars that shine so bright<br>But look away, remain a fool<br>For the land of Teyvat is perfect and true</p>
